# Awesome Web Developer
A curated list of web development URLs for Awesome Web Application Developer which all should be visited for at least one time before you die :)

We generally use browser bookmarking with Browser / Google account to keep all the nice websites in a single place in a organized way. But I think, their a lot of web developer just bookmarking a website and just bookmarking it and never back to reuse it from the bookmark list.

As always I tried to keep my eyes on Git that's why I am going to make this repository so the list will be more eye catching to me.

Also their are a lot of developer don't know that is the list of things he / she must know about, this is where they can find the list.
